As we celebrate 100 years of the @NatlParkService, Hillary has a plan to preserve America's 'best idea.'mercurynews.com/opinion/ci_299…
Trump himself is a fraud.  He's trying to scam America the way he scammed all those people at Trump University. amp.twimg.com/v/b299491a-065…
FACT: Trump University identified those most vulnerable and then targeted them with predatory marketing tactics. wapo.st/1WXQPz3
The Trump University con says a lot about Trump. If you can't trust him with your personal finances—how can we trust him with our country?
Trump's candidacy is built on his business 'credibility.' But his business record matches his character: His only concern is his own profit.
It's one thing to sell steaks using a name as a marketing ploy. Trump's company intentionally put people at risk. pic.twitter.com/5F4siYeO8p
Trump University employed instructors with no experience and lied to sell outrageously expensive packages. In a word: fraud.
Another Trump University practice, according to its own employees: target struggling families to fleece them. pic.twitter.com/VUH18SpBlD
Some of Trump University's tactics: push people to take on debt, cash out retirement, max out credit cards—whatever it took to buy classes.
The gist: Trump's for-profit university deceived & exploited students to take their money.  And he has the gall to call the media 'sleazy.'
New documents confirm Trump 'University' was a scam that preyed on families to make money. Caution—may cause nausea. nyti.ms/1TIQ6w5
Here's what I know. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. (1/2)
The actions of Trump University employees to prey on the poor and naive are just completely repulsive. nyti.ms/1r2nju9
Trump U is devastating because it's metaphor for his whole campaign: promising hardworking Americans way to get ahead, but all based on lies

'Enough is enough. It’s time we make quality child care affordable for all working families.' —Hillary
While families are struggling to pay for child care, Donald Trump actually argued that Americans are being paid too much.
A Kentucky parent earning the minimum wage spends 40% of their income on child care.  Let's make sure no family has to spend more than 10%.
Quality, affordable child care isn't a luxury for the few. It's a necessity that too many Americans are struggling to achieve.

Yet another idea from @realDonaldTrump that's ignorant, reckless, and frankly absurd. Sad! twitter.com/SopanDeb/statu…
At this point, Donald Trump has insulted the vast majority of Americans. The good news is, there's something we can all do about it: Vote.
Every woman—regardless of income or zip code—deserves access to health care. If you don't get that, you have no business being president.
Women, especially low-income women and women of color, are already being punished by GOP-led efforts to stigmatize and restrict health care.
Remember: If you make abortion a crime, you make women who seek abortions criminals. You put one in three women at risk.
The fact is, Trump isn't that different from every other Republican candidate who would also outlaw abortion.
Even by his impossibly low standards, @realDonaldTrump's suggestion that women be punished for seeking abortion is abhorrent.
Maya Angelou said: 'When people show you who they are, believe them.' Trump can try to walk back his words, but we heard him loud and clear.

New York is home to 20 million people. We don’t all look the same. We don’t all sound the same or worship the same, but we pull together.
Our next president has to be just as passionate about defending our people and our country as about fixing our economy.
'We need a president who will help break down all the barriers holding Americans back, not just some.' -Hillary
'This is NY. Nobody dreams bigger than we do. But this is a city that likes to get things done. That’s what we want from our president too.'

It’s not enough to make college more affordable. We need to help people with the student debt they already have. amp.twimg.com/v/8177ca07-345…
We need more love and kindness in America. Our best years can be ahead of us if we stand with each other. amp.twimg.com/v/9351f935-f26…
“When we stand together, there is no barrier too big to break.” What Hillary said after winning in South Carolina: hrc.io/1n6bhOo
The 'love and kindness' line @HillaryClinton used tonight isn't just a line. Read this @rubycramer profile. bzfd.it/1TKoUAZ
It may seem odd to hear someone running for president say we need more love and kindness in America—but we do. amp.twimg.com/v/05904838-fc6…

We need real plans to combat systemic racism and remove the barriers holding African Americans back. Hillary's plan: hrc.io/RacialJustice
'When we come together—all of us—with a sense of shared purpose and shared humanity, we can solve any problem and heal any divide.' —Hillary
'We need to recognize our privilege and practice humility, rather than assume that our experiences are everyone’s experiences.' —Hillary
'White Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk about the seen & unseen barriers that you face every day.'
'Ending systemic racism requires contributions from all of us—especially those of us who haven’t experienced it ourselves.' —Hillary
'Let's roll up our sleeves and get to work dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline...We need a cradle-to-college pipeline.' —Hillary
'We need to fix the crisis of mass incarceration...and end the epidemic of African Americans being killed by police or dying in custody.'
'We need end-to-end reform in our criminal justice system—not half-measures, but a full commitment with real follow-through.' —Hillary
'I’ll be the first to admit...I’ve made my own mistakes; I've walked my own journey. But I believe with all my heart that we can do better.'
Anyone asking for your vote has a responsibility to grapple with reality—to see things as they actually are, not just as we want them to be.
'These are not only problems of economic inequality. They are problems of racial inequality. We’ve got to say that loudly and clearly.'
'These inequities are wrong, but they’re also immoral. ... We have to begin by facing up to the reality of systemic racism.' —Hillary
'Something’s wrong when black kids get arrested for petty crimes but white CEOs get away with fleecing our entire country.' —Hillary
'We face a complex set of economic, social, and political challenges. They’re intersectional, reinforcing, & we’ve got to take them all on.'
It’s not a coincidence that the Flint water crisis was allowed to happen in a largely black, largely poor community.
'I want to talk about how we break down barriers that disproportionately affect African Americans, & build ladders of opportunity.' —Hillary
Watch live—Hillary speaks about how we can combat systemic racism and break down barriers for black families: hrc.io/1U6iH1H
We need a president who will tackle all the issues we face, from systemic racism to LGBT discrimination. amp.twimg.com/v/2fba5951-730…

Everyone has his or her own journey to the ballot box. Here are stories behind the votes. hrc.io/1Svmje0 pic.twitter.com/E6J0rXQ4e9
.@POTUS is doing his job by nominating a new Supreme Court justice. Tell Senate Republicans to do theirs: hrc.io/216ELLv
It's @POTUS' job to nominate Supreme Court justices, and the Senate has a responsibility to vote. hrc.io/247u6m6
11 So, a message for Senate Republicans: Fill this vacancy. @POTUS will do his job. Do yours. -H
10 As for complaints that this is an election year: 1988 was an election year, too—and Justice Kennedy was confirmed 97-0. -H
9 There are 339 days until the next president takes office. The Senate has never taken more than 125 days to vote on a SCOTUS nominee. -H
8 I have news for Republicans who would put politics over the Constitution: Refusing to do your duty isn’t righteous, it's disgraceful. -H
7 With these critical cases in the balance, Republicans wasted no time in vowing to block any SCOTUS nomination from @POTUS. A new low. -H
6 These decisions could determine whether we as a nation uphold our principles of liberty and equality, or turn back the clock. -H
5 And right now, a case from Texas could determine whether the right to abortion will be a reality for all or some. -H
4 Right now, the fundamental principle of 'one person, one vote” is at stake in a case before the Supreme Court. -H
3 Right now, millions of families are waiting for SCOTUS to decide on @POTUS' executive actions on immigration. -H
2 The need to fill the Supreme Court vacancy is not an occasion for politics as usual. This has real and urgent stakes for Americans now. -H
1 Until Jan. 20, 2017, it's @POTUS' job to nominate Supreme Court justices—it's right there in the Constitution. -H pic.twitter.com/AWV47TRaTw
Can we get back to politics, please? (Great job, @HamiltonMusical.) #Grammys

'All of us Democrats have a responsibility to make sure a Republican doesn’t win and rip away all the progress we've made.' —Hillary in CO

'Barack Obama is President of the United States until January 20, 2017—that is a fact, whether the Republicans like it or not.' —Hillary
'It's outrageous that Republicans...have already pledged to block any [Supreme Court] replacement that President Obama nominates.' —Hillary
