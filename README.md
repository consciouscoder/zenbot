# ZenBot - A Friendly bot network for the masses.

ZenBot is a full-stack (MEAN stack) app. The front-end is created in AngularJS and the
back-end is created in NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB.

ZenBot is a web application that brings friendly bots to the masses. ZenBot was created as
a full-stack MEAN application using server-to-server architecture on the back-end. This
means each bot is a PhantomJS HTTP server that talks to the primary Node.js web server.
The CasperJS library is used to drive the headless PhantomJS web browser. There are
currently four bots available: a Google scraper bot, a Twitter scraper bot, an automated
bot, and a zenbot. The data from the bot's work is stored in a MongoDB database and the
data can be viewed using D3 data visualization. JSON web tokens are used for user
authentication. Access available upon request.
