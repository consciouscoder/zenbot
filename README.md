### http://zenbot.io

ZenBot is a web application that brings friendly bots to the masses.

ZenBot is a full-stack (MEAN stack) responsive web app that uses microservices architecture. The front-end is created in AngularJS and the back-end is created in NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB. The bots are created in
NodeJS and CasperJS, using the headless PhantomJS browser to automate tasks and to scrape data.

There are currently four bots available: a Google scraper bot, a Twitter scraper bot, an automated
bot, and a Zenbot. The data from the bot's work is stored in a MongoDB database and the
data can be viewed using D3 data visualization. JSON web tokens are used for user
authentication.
